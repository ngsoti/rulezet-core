## Flask Application Template

### What's Included?

- Vue.js 3
- Blueprints
- Flask-Login for user authentication
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management
- Flask-WTF for form handling
- Flask-session for session management
- Predefined roles for users

### Installation

**It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment**

To learn more about virtual environments, [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) will guide you through it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py -i                            ## Initialize the database
```

### Configuration

Edit the `config.py` file:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for the application
- `FLASK_URL`: URL for the instance
- `FLASK_PORT`: Port for the instance
- `MISP_MODULE`: URL and port where the MISP module is running

### Launching the Application

```bash
./launch.sh -l
```

## Project Summary

This internship offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the development of a cutting-edge, open-source platform: a community-driven website designed for sharing, evaluating, and refining security detection rules. These rules, which are critical for identifying threats in cybersecurity, currently lack a central place for community validation. This project addresses that gap by creating a collaborative space where users can:

- **Share Rules**: Contribute detection rules in various formats (YARA, Sigma, Suricata, and others), allowing for broad community access.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Rate and comment on the effectiveness of rules, report false positives, and share practical experiences.
- **Refine Rules**: Participate in the collaborative improvement of rules through feedback and proposed changes, enhancing their accuracy and reliability.
- **Organize Rules**: Bundle rules into logical sets and classify them using tags and categories, improving searchability and usability.

Interns will play a key role in developing the websiteâ€™s features and functionalities. This will involve implementing core features, exploring integrations with other security tools such as MISP and Suricata, and assisting in the development of a security rule data model for a standardized format to facilitate easy exchange. Interns will gain hands-on experience in open-source software development, web development, and practical cybersecurity applications. 

This project offers a chance to make a real-world impact by improving the way security professionals interact with essential threat detection information. You will gain exposure to web development, APIs, data modeling, and security knowledge.

**Website for Sharing, Commenting, and Rating Rules (Crowdsourced Rules Website)**

- Share rules and let the community vote and add comments (e.g., good, bad, generating false positives).
- Users can register and have the following permissions:
  - Add rules
  - Comment on rules
  - Bundle rules (like vulnerability lookup)
  - Rate rules (including false-positive rates and reviewing taxonomy for rule evaluation)
